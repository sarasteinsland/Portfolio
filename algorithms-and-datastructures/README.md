# 🧮 Algorithmic Analysis & Data Structures – PG4200

This repository presents the final semester project for the course *Algorithms and Data Structures* (PG4200) at Kristiania University College, completed in Spring 2025. The project was developed collaboratively as a group assignment and received a grade of **B**, reflecting strong analytical depth and technical execution.

## 📘 Project Summary

The assignment focused on designing, implementing, and analyzing algorithms to solve computational problems with efficiency and clarity. The report includes both theoretical analysis and practical implementation, demonstrating proficiency in:

- Recursive problem-solving
- Time and space complexity evaluation
- Sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Search techniques (Binary Search)
- Data structures: arrays, linked lists, trees

## 🧪 Technologies

- **Python**: Core implementation language
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for testing and visualization
- **LaTeX/Markdown**: For structured documentation and report formatting

## 🤝 Collaboration
