# 🧮 Algorithmic Analysis & Data Structures – PG4200

This repository contains the final semester project for the course *Algorithms and Data Structures* (PG4200) at Kristiania University College, completed in Spring 2025. The project was developed collaboratively in a group and received a grade of **B**, reflecting strong analytical depth and technical execution.

## 📘 Project Overview

The assignment focused on designing, implementing, and analyzing algorithms to solve computational problems efficiently. The work demonstrates proficiency in:

- Recursive problem-solving
- Time and space complexity evaluation
- Sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- Search techniques: Binary Search
- Data structures: arrays, linked lists, trees

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Java** – Core implementation language
- **Object-Oriented Design** – Modular structure with reusable classes
- **CLI-based Testing** – Console output and input validation
- **UML Diagrams** – Used for planning and structure (if applicable)

## 🤝 Collaboration

This project was completed as part of a group assignment. Responsibilities were distributed across design, implementation, testing, and documentation. The final report reflects joint contributions and collective problem-solving.
